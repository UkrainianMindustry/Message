## Building the Bot

To build the bot, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

If you encounter any issues, such as Gradle being unable to find specific Arc or Mindustry packages, you can refer to the [Mindustry Java Mod Template repository](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryJavaModTemplate/) for additional guidance and troubleshooting.
